I'm Satya, a results-driven professional with 8+ years of experience in program management and rural development. My learnings have been in the areas of agri-value-chain development, partnerships, and empowering rural women through e-commerce.

My educational background includes a Master's in Public Administration and an MBA in Finance from Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Andhra Pradesh. I'm interested in learning about applications of blockchain in the development sector and I play the saxophone in a band named Rhythmic Energy.
